# **Multi-Agent System for AI-Powered Market Research, Use Case Generation, and Resource Collection**

This repository implements a **multi-agent system** to automate **market research**, **AI/ML use case generation**, and **resource collection**. It uses **GPT-4**, **Gradio**, **Langchain**, **LangGraph**, and **Tavily API** to generate actionable AI solutions tailored to industries or companies.

## **Features**
- **Market Research**: Analyze industries or companies, providing insights into trends, competitors, and technology adoption.
- **Use Case Generation**: Create AI, ML, and automation use cases based on research findings.
- **Resource Collection**: Gather datasets, tools, and APIs for implementing AI solutions.
- **Gradio Interface**: User-friendly interface for input, progress tracking, and output retrieval.

## **Technologies Used**
- **GPT-4**: For generating insights and use cases.
- **Langchain**: Framework for language model-powered applications.
- **LangGraph**: Graph-based tool for modeling agent workflows.
- **Tavily API**: Web scraping for research data.
- **Gradio**: For building the interactive UI.

## **Workflow**
1. **User Input**: Provide an industry or company query.
2. **Research**: The system gathers insights on trends, competitors, and technology adoption.
3. **Use Case Generation**: AI/ML use cases are created based on the research.
4. **Resource Collection**: The system identifies datasets, tools, and APIs required to implement the use cases.
5. **Output**: Results are saved to a file and displayed in the Gradio interface for easy access.
