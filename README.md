# **Multi-Agent System for AI-Powered Market Research, Use Case Generation, and Resource Collection**

This repository implements a **multi-agent system** designed to automate **market research**, **AI/ML use case generation**, and **resource collection** for AI/ML/Automation solutions. The system uses advanced AI models (GPT-4), tools like **Gradio**, **Langchain**, **Langgraph**, and **Tavily API** to help users explore AI-driven solutions tailored to industries or companies. This enables organizations to drive innovation, make data-driven decisions, and efficiently generate actionable AI use cases.

## **Features**
- **Market Research Agent**: Analyzes and generates detailed reports on industries or companies, including market trends, competitor analysis, and technology adoption.
- **Use Case Generation Agent**: Leverages the research data to create actionable AI, ML, and automation use cases specific to the user’s industry.
- **Resource Collection Agent**: Identifies and collects datasets, pre-trained models, APIs, and open-source tools required to implement the AI use cases.
- **Generative AI Integration**: Utilizes powerful large language models (GPT-4) for generating insightful, creative, and data-backed content.
- **Gradio Interface**: Provides an interactive user interface for submitting queries, viewing progress, and retrieving results.

## **Technologies Used**
- **GPT-4**: Large language model for generating research insights and AI use cases.
- **Langchain**: A framework for building applications powered by language models.
- **Langgraph**: A graph-based tool to model agent-based systems and workflows.
- **Tavily API**: A web scraping tool used to gather search results for research.
- **Gradio**: A Python library for building user-friendly interfaces, used here for interaction and progress tracking.

## **Workflow**
1. **Industry/Company Research**: Researches the industry or company based on the user’s input. It provides insights into key trends, competitors, and technology adoption in the selected domain.
2. **AI Use Case Generation**: Based on the research results, the system generates impactful AI, ML, and automation use cases specific to the given industry or company. It ensures that use cases are innovative and relevant.
3. **Resource Collection**: Identifies datasets, tools, and pre-trained models required to implement the generated use cases. It collects resources from external platforms like Kaggle, HuggingFace, and GitHub, making them accessible and practical for implementation.

## **How it Works**
The multi-agent system consists of three main agents:
- **Research Agent**: Responsible for gathering and analyzing market information.
- **Use Case Agent**: Uses the research to generate actionable AI and automation use cases.
- **Resource Agent**: Collects relevant datasets, APIs, and models to support the use cases.

Each agent performs a specific task, and the results are passed between them in a sequential process:
1. The user provides an **industry or company query**.
2. The **Research Agent** fetches insights from available data and generates a report.
3. The **Use Case Agent** generates AI/ML use cases based on the research output.
4. The **Resource Agent** collects datasets and tools for the use cases.
5. All results are saved to a file for future reference.

The entire workflow is managed in a **Gradio interface**, where users can track the progress of each step.
